    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheet</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen ,paper,on in other media</li>
        <li><span class="linethrough"> css is not neccessary</span>  <span class="highlight"> CSS saves lot of work</span> it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once </li>
        <li class="underline">externel stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
    </ol>

    <p>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>

    <ul type="circle">
        <li>inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>internel-by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>Externel-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>the most comman way to add CSS , is to keep the styles in external CSS  files .however , <span class="highlight">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </span></li>because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself.
    </ul>
    <div class="para">
        <p class="para">when comparing CSS class vs ID, the diffrence is that CSS applies a style to multiple elements ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by java script </p>

        <p class="para">in CSS .selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on aweb page. once an element has been targeted.a style or set of atyles can be apllied  to the element.</p>
